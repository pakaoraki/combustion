# 0.7.0

### Note:

The Combustion project looks not maintained anymore, this is a fork for an more updated version. 'React-toolbox' and 'React-transmission' seems also not active anymore since 2019, so in the future, it could be better to re-write almost from scratch with a maintained framework (like MUI for example). 

- Update 'React-toolbox' to the latest version (2.0.0-beta.13). 
- Implementing BlockList feature in Settings.
- Fix Favicon missing.
- Add new 'sort direction' feature.
- Add a dark theme (visual from [dark-combustion](https://github.com/SebDanielsson/dark-combustion)).
- Add automatic theme selection option.
- Fix Inspector behavior: do not show if none selected torrents. 
- Filter only .torrent files when uploading.
- Fix default download dir path not showing when add torrent dialog renders.
- Improve visual:
  - Inspector Tabs: make icons bigger.
  - Add context icons for Dialogs.
  - Partly redesign Files Tree, add some background and icons.
  - Resize prompt dialogs   .
